Resumes are dead.
Focus on quality efficiency / humane value. 
Join the revolution. 

Humane marketplace for quality partners.

Putting a cap on the body count game.

Everyone still has profiles,
but to initiate any conversation,
money has to be on the line. 
This forces the initiator 
to do their homework
or waste time and money
in a spray and pray approach!

$5/month subscription to be on site. 
Weeds out free-riders. 
Only communicate via site
to prevent spam.

No personally identifiable information
to prevent concious or unconcious bias?

Getting passed transactions 
to longer-term thinking and actions.

## For career progressors

Tired of wasting time
tons of "easy" applications
or asked to complete challenges 
before even speaking to a single person?

No more resume template non-sense. 
Forced to apply with understanding of a business
and what value you can bring to it. 
These are table stakes;
if you haven't taken the time to understand
a business and its domain,
why should a company even take time talking to you?

You get to make something less than the value
you can propose if it's accurate. 

Simulates what you can do 
for any application via
email or cover letters,
but not the same community. 
Too much middle-management
that has lost sight of 
providing value to the business
and its customers. 

$5/application for skin in the game. 
Limited to 10 applications per month.

## For Founders

Tired of sifting through millions of applicants? 

Limited to quality applicants. 
Focus on a few high quality entrants. 

They haven taken the time to understand your business
and how they can add value to it. 

No resume dissection or game playing. 
Play garbage games, win garbage. 

$5/application accepted. 
You set limits based on what you can handle.
Forcing function to think about what you're 
making other people go through. 

Skin in the game. 
Must pay applicants to not waste anyone's time.

Can message applicants,
but you must go through the same process.
Costs money and time,
must study applicant's background
and why it is a good fit. 

Helpful for non-large companies
which can do this themselves
by forcing applicants
to submit how they add value
-but they don't. 

The whole system is broken. 
People have developed the habits
and conditioned to think the status quo is OK. 
It's not and wastes a lot of people's time
on both sides. 

Pay for top dollar
for top talent. 
If genuine applicants are showing
how they can do the work profitably,
pay up. 
These are business partners 
that have invested a lot of
time and energy
to specifically focus on 
you as a company and how they can 
provide value. 
As you refine their assumptions 
with real data, 
pay them what they can 
bring to the table, 
and not some predetermined 
budget without people that care.

Focus hiring funnel here only
for best applicants. 
Find people that care,
then have some standardized task
that simulates a real work environment. 
May be nothing better than 
starting out as a contracting apprentice
and graduating to full-time partner. 

## On-boarding and incentivizing a great culture

Perhaps everyone starts as
an apprentice;
lower pay, 
but pay is immediately increased 
for good behavior
or additional value to business.
No limits as long as things continue. 

Want to incentivize 
good performance,
but also helping others 
be more efficient
with best practices.
